# Barba

Barba is a multilingual model for [Natural Language Inference](https://paperswithcode.com/task/natural-language-inference) (NLI) and [zero-shot text classification](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html#Classification-as-Natural-Language-Inference), available as an end-to-end service through TensorFlow Serving. It is based on [XLM-RoBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116), and is trained on selected subsets of [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/), [XNLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XNLI), [MultiNLI](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/), [OCNLI](https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/OCNLI), [ANLI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/anli), and other private datasets.
